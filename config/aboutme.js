    <h4 class="blockquote text-primary">Creative and Persistent</h4>
		<p>I love using creativity and logic to solve problems and gain deep knowledge about why and how something is working or not working.</p>
		<p><strong>I am obsessed over getting it done, knowing why, and understanding how</strong> - to such an extent that I will teach myself a new coding language or statistical model or third-party application so that I can answer the question, offer ideas, and propose solutions.</p>		
    <h4 class="blockquote text-primary">Collaborative and Process-Oriented</h4>
		<p> I love planning around group work, and streamlining the innovation process. <strong>I thrive in planning mode</strong>, and am often the note-taker and scheduler: turning creative ideas in defined project roadmaps and orchestrating streamlined processes to get our to-do list completed.</p>
